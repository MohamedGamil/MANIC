MANIC stands for MongoDB, AngularJS, NodeJS, Ionic and Cordova. This stack allows applications to be built using Javascript end-to-end and distributed on the web and as near native mobile apps.

##MongoDB
Application developers love MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database, for its speed, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. With an intuitive data model and powerful features that include dynamic queries, secondary indexes, and atomic in-place updates, MongoDB is well-suited as a back-end for modern web applications. Its schema-free design encourages rapid application development, and built-in replication and an auto-sharding architecture allow for massive parallel distribution.

##AngularJS
Ionic is an open source framework that blends the best features of AngularJS with Cordova (previously known as Phonegap) to package your web application into a native-quality mobile app. Using Ionic, you can build clean, fast, and feature rich mobile apps using the web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that you already know. Ionic also provides a number of integrated services such as visual rapid prototyping using the Creator tool and easy sharing of apps using the Ionic View tool.

##NodeJS
JavaScript on the server? You bet. Node.js is a JavaScript server capable of supporting scalable, high-performance web applications. Using asynchronous I/O, the server can do more than one thing at a time, a key requirement for real-time apps like chat, games, and live statistics. And since it's JavaScript, you use the same language end to end.

##Ionic Framework

##Cordova

Apache Cordova provides a common set of APIs to access native device functionality such as the filesystem, camera, and contacts from apps written in HTML, CSS and Javascript, along with a command line tool to produce the binaries required for multiple mobile platforms. Cordova boasts a vibrant open source plugin ecosystem providing hooks into multiple device features and adding support for multiple different types of applications. Better still, when you use Cordova with Ionic Framework, you can deploy your HTML based apps as native applications on any mobile device.
